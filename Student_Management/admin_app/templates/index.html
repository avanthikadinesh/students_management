    <h1>TULIPS</h1>
    <p>Tulips are popular, spring-blooming flowers known for their large, showy, cup-shaped blooms that come in nearly every color imaginable. They grow from bulbs planted in autumn, produce one or more thick bluish-green leaves at the base of the stem, and typically have six petals and six stamens. The flowers are part of the lily family and originated in Central Asia, becoming a major industry in the Netherlands.</p>
